# Linked List and Binary Tree Algorithms
In this project I implemented a student database system using dynamic memory allocation for linked list and binary tree. The program saves the data into binary files. 

Student entries are kept in a linked list or balanced binary tree (ordered alphabetically by name) with memory allocated when a new student is introduced by the user. Memory is deallocated when a user is removed.

## The Menu presented to the user are as follows:

1. Introduce student
2. Remove student
3. Introduce marks
4. Print students report
5. Print report for all students
6. Save to file
7. Retrieve data from file
8. Exit
