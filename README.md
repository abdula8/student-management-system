# Linked List and Binary Tree Algorithms

## About 

* In this project I implemented a student database system using dynamic memory allocation for linked list and binary tree. The program saves the data into binary files. 

* Student entries are kept in a linked list or balanced binary tree (ordered alphabetically by name) with memory allocated when a new student is introduced by the user. Memory is deallocated when a user is removed.
