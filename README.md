# LinkedList-BinaryTree
Linked List and Binary Tree Algorithms


In this project I implemented a student database system using dynamic memory allocation for linked list and binary tree. The program saves the data into binary files. 

Student entries should are kept in a linked (ordered alphabetically by name) list with memory allocated when a new student is introduced by the user. Memory should is deallocated when a user is removed.

The Menu presented to the user are as follows:
1) Introduce student
2) Remove student
3) Introduce marks
4) Print students report
5) Print report for all students
6) Save to file
7) Retrieve data from file
8) Exit
